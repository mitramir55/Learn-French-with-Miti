# ü•ê Learn-French-with-Miti

This is a Flask webapp I created for learning the articles (le, la, les) and french words better. As I often found these female/male property confusing, I decided to create this as a way to both learn french and get comfortable with js.

This app is connected to an excel file - which you can find in the repo- with all the vocabulary I've learned so far about different topics. Whenever you choose to start a new topic, just create a new excel sheet and the app will automatically add this topic to the front page. The Definitions and links to dictionary page is scraped and added to the list once you complete the list of articles.

If you've filled all correctly, you'll get confetti on your screen to celebrate your massive knowledge of French language XD
